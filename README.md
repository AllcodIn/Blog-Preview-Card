## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project allows me to know how to constraint content width to a certain range and improve my knowledge about responsive design in order to complete it and match it with different screen sizes.

```css
h2 {
    max-width: -moz-fit-content;
    max-width: fit-content;
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 1440px){
    .card {
        max-width: 50vh;
        height: 85vh;
    }
    h2 {
        margin: 0px;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I still have a lot to learn about responsive design because it took me too much time in this project.
